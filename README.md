Publically Viewable samples of my programming, mostly chosen as either clean or interesting pieces that are relatively short and so can be shown without additional context
(currently all C# but entirely coincidentally, I have some current projects in python but they do not lend themselves well to being viewable samples)

Bacterium.cs -- The class of my bacterium object for a bacterial colony simulation project done at university
Dominos.cs -- Programming exercise given by previous prospective employer to create a chain of dominos from a set
ImageModule.cs -- A discord bot module that compresses a given image into a representation of that image using the coloured square emojis
